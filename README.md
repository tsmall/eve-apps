# Eve Apps

This repository contains apps that I've written in the [Eve programming
language][eve]. Eve is still a very young project, but it's a very exciting
one. It's what Chris Granger always wanted for LightTable, plus more.

Eve brings many ideas together in one package:

* A dynamic, real-time coding environment
* Declarative data querying based on Datalog
* Combining databases and code into one thing
* Literate Programming

The idea is very exciting and interesting. Eve is a superset of [Markdown][md].
All Eve programs written are valid Markdown. So you can read my programs,
completely marked up, right here in GitHub.

Or, at least, you should be able to. Unfortunately GitHub doesn't yet recognize
that `.eve` files are valid Markdown and renders them as raw text. So I've added a `.md` suffix to all of my files.

## My programs

Here are the programs I've written so far, in the order I've written them.
