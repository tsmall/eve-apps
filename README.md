# Eve Apps

This repository contains apps that I've written in the [Eve programming
language][eve]. Eve is still a very young project, but it's a very exciting
one. It's what Chris Granger always wanted for LightTable, plus more.

Eve brings many ideas together in one package:

* A dynamic, real-time coding environment
* Declarative data querying based on Datalog
* Combining databases and code into one thing
* Literate Programming

The idea is very exciting and interesting. Eve is a superset of [Markdown][md].
All Eve programs written are valid Markdown. So you can read my programs,
completely marked up, right here in GitHub.
